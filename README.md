## Description (100-word minimum)

The project we are developing is a restaurant POS System designed with the customer and ease of access in mind. 
Its purpose is that it is designed to reduce consumer wait time by allowing the customer to place their own order for food. 
Not only that, but the system also allows the employees to manage customers and their orders in an efficient way by providing an easy-to-use 
interface for the employees to manage and modify based on customer activity. Lastly, we know how difficult and stressful managing a restaurant can be, 
so weâ€™ve also developed this system in order to allow managers to efficiently manage and modify the specifics of their restaurant. 
The system overall decreases the stress and pressures on managers and employees, while increasing the pleasure of customers!
